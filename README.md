# 🔥 Autonomous AI Research Agent (AIRA)

A self-updating RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system designed to autonomously research, analyze, and experiment with the latest developments in AI/ML/NLP.

## 🎯 Overview

AIRA is an intelligent research assistant that autonomously finds, retrieves, and summarizes the latest research papers, blogs, and news from various academic sources. It can detect paradigm shifts in research, self-update its knowledge base, and run experiments in isolated environments.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Multi-Agent System**: Specialized agents for retrieval, summarization, knowledge graph building, and execution
- **Hybrid Search**: Combined vector similarity and structured metadata filtering
- **Temporal Awareness**: Track research trends using topic modeling
- **Autonomous Self-Improvement**: Self-evaluation and retrieval strategy refinement
- **Long-Term Memory**: Persistent storage of interactions and insights
- **Human-in-the-Loop Feedback**: User feedback system for improving retrieval quality

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Core Framework**: LangChain (Agents, Chains, Memory)
- **Vector Storage**: FAISS / Weaviate / ChromaDB
- **Language Models**: GPT-4 / Gemini / LLaMA-3
- **Web Scraping**: BeautifulSoup / Scrapy
- **Research APIs**: ArXiv API / Semantic Scholar API
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Vertex AI / Google Cloud Functions

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aira.git
cd aira

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🔧 Configuration

1. Set up environment variables:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"
export SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR_API_KEY="your-semantic-scholar-key"
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="your-gcp-project"
```

2. Configure the system in `config.py`:
```python
VECTOR_STORE_TYPE = "faiss"  # or "weaviate" or "chromadb"
UPDATE_INTERVAL = 3600  # Knowledge base update interval in seconds
MAX_PAPERS_PER_UPDATE = 100
```

## 🚀 Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from aira.main import AIRA

# Initialize the system
aira = AIRA()

# Query the latest research
results = await aira.query("Latest developments in transformer architecture")

# Run an experiment
experiment = await aira.run_experiment(
    code="your_experiment_code",
    experiment_id="exp_001"
)
```

### API Endpoints

The system provides RESTful API endpoints:

- `POST /api/query`: Submit research queries
- `POST /api/experiment`: Run experiments
- `GET /api/status`: Check system status
- `POST /api/feedback`: Submit feedback
